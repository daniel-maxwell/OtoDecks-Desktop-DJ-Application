# OtoDecks-Desktop-DJ-Application

OtoDecks DJ is a simple, intuitive desktop DJ application for Windows (MacOS support pending!). Load playlists in to the program from your music library in a wide array of formats including .wav, .mp3 and .ogg. Users can play and mix tracks simultaneously with controls for gain, tempo (playback speed) and filtering by frequency (Low, Mid and High bands). Tracks loaded on to decks can be scrubbed in real time by clicking the desired cue point on the waveform display. Playlists are saved in local storage, so your favourite tracks will be ready to go upon loading the application.
